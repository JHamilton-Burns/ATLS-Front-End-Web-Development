# Project 1 Process
## Milestone 1

PROJECT OVERVIEW: I’m a big fan of tennis and to this date I’ve not had the opportunity to build out a tennis project through ATLAS. That’s why i’m hoping this is my big opportunity. Through this topic, I’m looking to focus on 3 of the 4 grandslams, the US Open, Australian Open and French Open to showcase a timeline of tennis player outfits by major sponsors like Nike and Addidas (they sponsor the majority of players). I have always found it interesting that players during each tournament show up wearing the same outfits and thought a playful idea would be to showcase yearly color palette/style trends that, for better or for worse, have an influence/are constantly refrenced throughout the tournaments. My main influence for this idea, is the New York Times Front Row to Fashion Week page https://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/13/fashion-week-editors-picks/index.html that displays the fingerprint of each fashion collection by designers. [Note, I am still on the fence about including Wimbledon in this project, due to strict rules that require players to only wear white.]

Overall, my goal is to keep this fun, lighthearted, and intriguing. I love the way the New York Times used data to drive the pop-culture topic of fashion and made it fun to do so. In this vein, I plan to make an interactive data visualization where you can select a grandslam as well as a sponsor and a collection out outfits showcased in a strip will appear for the user to pan through and learn about the design choices over the years. To keep this achievable, I plan to choose 5 years of outfits. I will source data and images online and from the sponsors. I hope to keep this fun for tennis fans and maybe interest some non-tennis fans as well. 

STRETCH GOALS: I have many friends that don’t understand the difference between the tournaments and would love to make this an educational piece as well. Many don’t understand the different between the courts and their speed. They’re unaware of the varying rules between each tournament nor the difference between lengths for men’s and women’s matches. It would be neat to add these stats to each page in a visual way to create interest.

WIREFRAMES: As I wireframed this project, I realized there were many features i’d like to include. So few Americans understand the intricacies of the grand slam tournaments and I’d really like to synthesize the primary differences in a digestible way. Therefore, on each page, I’d like to pull out the the easiest facts to get the gist of the differences and why they mean so much to the game of tennis. I also wanted to emphasize the outfit component of tennis and how trends widely differ by brand, tournament, and year. This is an exciting part of the game and in a sense creates a new and refreshing vibe from year-to-year.

JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY: Through this project, I’m looking forward to learning d3.js to boost the data visualizaition effects of my project. I’ve never used it, but believe that after reading through the intro, it would be very useful for the parallax-esque visuals I’d like to achieve. I am a bit slower at coding, but I do love the challenge of learning a new library and testing the waters. I have high expectations for this project, and hope that i’m not biting off more than I can chew. Regardless, I’m gonna give it my all!
