## Milestone 1

IDEATION: The key to my portal design is to create clean and simple design. This is my first time working developing a site from scratch and although I have experience with Webflow, I don’t want to bite of more than I can chew. The idea is to use the CMS functionality in Wordpress to streamline the architecture of the site and to stick to cards that consistantly have an image, a tag, a title and a description. To better visualize what this card design might look like, I created some low-fidelity sketches on paper and then migrated the idea to a mid-fidelity wireframe in Figma.

HOMEPAGE: The wireframe for the homepage features a navbar with my name and the course title. As well as two cards that link to my labs and my projects. I plan to create a bit of background animation when hovering over the card and having the title underlined when hovering as well.

LABS & PROJECTS: The wireframe for the labs and projects pages feature a similar navbar with my name and the heading. However, I have reduced the height of the cards to condence the realestate on the page and allow for more cards. I also introduced a back button to allow users to head back to the homepage. The idea is that those visiting the labs and projects pages can choose to view the project by clicking the Title or check out the code by selecting “View the code.”

MOBILE: Considering how the site may look in mobile, I also provided some simplistic mid-fidelity wireframes. To factor in the responsiveness of the cards, I simply narrowed the width and extended the height of the pages. I currently have the nav bars featuring my name and have dropped the heading to the body of the page to help narrow width of the mobile device.

ARCHITECTURE, COMPONENTS, & COLORS: To keep the card designs consistant, I created master components and applied autolayout to all text elements to assist when adjusting page sizing. To keep the design of the pages clean and easy on the eyes, I used coolors.co and opted for lighter tones for the background with pops of color for tags.

INITIAL GOAL: I had this dream of achieving the MVP on one go and boy was I in for a treat. This process taught me a ton about my coding stamina and brought me back down to reality. Although, I had moments of despair and considered trashing the entire project numerous times, I'd like to give credit to the W3School Tryit Editor and the hundreds of forums online that helped with troubleshooting. Despite my dramatic hurdles with coding, I will say I am endlessly grateful to have experience with Webflow. I've spent many nights pulling out my hair over flex boxes and imagine it'll continue well into the future, but the experience truly helped me keep my cool during this process. Anyways, my initial goal was to capture the architecture of the wireframe I created in Milestone 1 and bring the simple card layout I designed into reality. 

REALITY: Unfortunately, I ran into a handful of hiccups that seemed to stem from my disorganized html code. Therefore, I revamped the code numerous times to avoid repetition and try to make sense of the hierarchy of the div blocks, sections, etc. To be truthful, I found it very helpful to do code comparisons with Peter's website and to constantly review other suggestions on web forums to help me through the most challenging parts: like using "../" to reference files within a folder or using [<h1><a href="">Title</a></h1>] to stylize links. Concepts like these are so nitpicky to go over in class, so I enjoyed hunting for solutions. 

BIGGEST CHALLENGES: I couldn't manage to get attractive yellow tags on each card without compromising the spacing. Therefore, for the time being I have decided to do without them. At this time, not all of the coding links are properly working due to a lack of completed assignments. I hope to work on this as we continue class. Finally, my biggest frustration by far has to do running code on Chrome. I frequently run into errors from the js file that pops up and have to delete it and rerun in order to avoid errors in Chrome. I have yet to find a better work around and am not sure if this is the fault of my browser, my computer or just a me thing. 

GOALS: As I learn more javascript, I hope to add more flair to the site with hover elements. I'd also like to clean up my main.css file. At this time I struggle with the difference between "id" and "class". I hope as I continue with this course, I'll learn the best practices.
