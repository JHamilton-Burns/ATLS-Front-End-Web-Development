# Class Portal Process

## Milestone 1

IDEATION: The key to my portal design is to create clean and simple design. This is my first time working developing a site from scratch and although I have experience with Webflow, I don’t want to bite of more than I can chew. The idea is to use the CMS functionality in Wordpress to streamline the architecture of the site and to stick to cards that consistantly have an image, a tag, a title and a description. To better visualize what this card design might look like, I created some low-fidelity sketches on paper and then migrated the idea to a mid-fidelity wireframe in Figma.

HOMEPAGE: The wireframe for the homepage features a navbar with my name and the course title. As well as two cards that link to my labs and my projects. I plan to create a bit of background animation when hovering over the card and having the title underlined when hovering as well.

LABS & PROJECTS: The wireframe for the labs and projects pages feature a similar navbar with my name and the heading. However, I have reduced the height of the cards to condence the realestate on the page and allow for more cards. I also introduced a back button to allow users to head back to the homepage. The idea is that those visiting the labs and projects pages can choose to view the project by clicking the Title or check out the code by selecting “View the code.”

MOBILE: Considering how the site may look in mobile, I also provided some simplistic mid-fidelity wireframes. To factor in the responsiveness of the cards, I simply narrowed the width and extended the height of the pages. I currently have the nav bars featuring my name and have dropped the heading to the body of the page to help narrow width of the mobile device.

COMPONENTS & COLORS: To keep the card designs consistant, I created master components and applied autolayout to all text elements to assist when adjusting page sizing. To keep the design of the pages clean and easy on the eyes, I used coolors.co and opted for lighter tones for the background with pops of color for tags.
