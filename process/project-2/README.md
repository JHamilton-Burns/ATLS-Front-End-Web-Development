## Milestone 1
### PROJECT OVERVIEW: 

I’m using this project as a jumping off point for my thesis project. During the pandemic I was diagnosed with Alpha-gal and have since had to learn to significantly adjust my diet to avoid anaphylaxis. As I’ve continued to learn about the syndrome, I’ve become fascinated by the lack of knowledge physicians, chefs and my peers have on this ever-growing epidemic. In fact, I’ve had numerous occasions where people don’t believe it exists, so I’m hoping this “pocket guide” will shed a bit of light on the topic. 

To begin, I consulted my favorite AGS site that has helped clarify so much for me: https://alphagalinformation.org/ However, the content is quite dense to parse through. Therefore, I thought it would be useful to have a shortend version to quickly use as a reference when I’m explaining what AGS is. I’m hoping to expand upon this in my thesis project by designing an allergy app that different organizations can use to place content for their allergy patients. I’ll use Alpha-gal as an example and have community forums, quick health references, educational tools, etc. 


### STRETCH GOALS:

My goal is to inform people about a topic they know little about in a shortened way. I’d like to do this using JS animations as well and d3.js for complex data visualization. I’m thinking to grab data on tick migration, I will begin my search with government organizations like the Forest Service, World Health Organization or the USDA. Since this is a "pocket guide", I'd like to make this site responsive on cellphones to allow for easy access on the go. 

### WIREFRAME:

As I wireframed this project, I realized I needed to drill down to the basics. Many people I meet aren’t aware of AGS and need to learn a) what it is, b) how one gets it, c) where they get it, d) triggers, e) reactions, and f) why it is concerning. I wanted the site to feel educational, organized and easy to navigate. I’m hoping placing content under large headers will help with readability and comprehension. Colors were inspired by Coolors and are not intentionally following the colors of the Belgian flag.

### JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY:

Through this project, I’m looking forward to taking a second stab at d3.js. I think this is the perfect project to enhance with strong data visualization and my hope is to successfully generate interactive maps and charts. ex. https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/walmarts-growth


## Milestone 2
### INITIAL TAKEAWAYS: 

As an initial start to building the site, I’ve gone ahead and started with the basics. I’ve built out the shell of the site where I’ve arranged the html and css pages. I currently have placeholder charts, graphs and maps to get the general idea of the flow of the guide. So far so good, but I have yet to begin the challenging part of the project where I introduce interactive data visualization through d3.js. 

### DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:

At present, my code is incredibly basic and incorporates the fonts, images, html and css pages. For some reason it seems easier for me to play around within each page prior to incorporating a module bundler. I intend to do this when I’m approaching the finalalization of the page. 

To be honest, I am a bit concerned about approaching d3.js again. However, I’m always up for a challenge and believe I can begin with the more basic charts like the pie chart and bar graph. The biggest challenge I forsee is generating an interactive map showcasing the migration of lone star ticks. Luckily, it does appear that there are a decent amount of data souces on occurances of lone star ticks (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314611/#pone.0209082.s001) and I find this encouraging for the next stages of this project. 

Here is a screenshot of the current state of the site:

## Milestone 4
### REFLECTION:

This project got me very excited for next semester. My plan is to use this concept as my inspiration to design an Alpha-Gal app to share stories, create community and education for everyone with the syndrome. Ideally this could be used for other food allergy or diseases as well. It can be very challenging dealing with the side effects when the vast majority of people with the sydrome live on the east coast, I'd love to create a platform for people to come together like a virtual support group instead of having to use a poorly managed/followed sub-reddit.

Ultimately, I am pleased with the end result of this project. Learning how to incorporate d3.js was far more of a challenge than I anticipated. After spending days trying to incorporate charts and graphs, I unfortunately didn't have the time to add animations I had originally intended. I did find that maybe d3.js is better suited for more robust projects and for strong coders. It's capabilities are absolutely incredible, but it also needd a lot of data, time, and backhand knowledge to generate the enticing graphs shown as examples on their site.
