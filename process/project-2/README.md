Project Overview

I’m using this project as a jumping off point for my thesis project. During the pandemic I was diagnosed with Alpha-gal and have since had to learn to significantly adjust my diet to avoid anaphylaxis. As I’ve continued to learn about the syndrome, I’ve become fascinated by the lack of knowledge physicians, chefs and my peers have on this ever-growing epidemic. In fact, I’ve had numerous occasions where people don’t believe it exists, so I’m hoping this “pocket guide” will shed a bit of light on the topic. 

To begin, I consulted my favorite AGS site that has helped clarify so much for me: https://alphagalinformation.org/

However, the content is quite dense to parse through. Therefore, I thought it would be useful to have a shortend version to quickly use as a reference when I’m explaining what AGS is. I’m hoping to expand upon this in my thesis project by designing an allergy app that different organizations can use to place content for their allergy patients. I’ll use Alpha-gal as an example and have community forums, quick health references, educational tools, etc. 

Stretch Goals

My goal is to inform people about a topic they know little about in a shortened way. I’d like to do this using JS animations as well and d3.js for complex data visualization. I’m thinking to grab data on tick migration, I will begin my search with government organizations like the Forest Service, World Health Organization or the USDA.

Wireframe

As I wireframed this project, I realized I needed to drill down to the basics. Many people I meet aren’t aware of AGS and need to learn a) what it is, b) how one gets it, c) where they get it, d) triggers, e) reactions, and f) why it is concerning. I wanted the site to feel educational, organized and easy to navigate. I’m hoping placing content under large headers will help with readability and comprehension. Colors were inspired by Coolors and are not intentionally following the colors of the Belgian flag.
