## Milestone 3

PROJECT OVERVIEW: Our team is looking to generate a virtual Marauder’s Map experience for all Harry Potter fans. We hope to implement animated footsteps that indicate where someone is walking throughout the Hogwart’s castle and grounds.  

TEAM ROLES:

Megan Dukek: Animations | Jessie Hamilton-Burns: Visuals | Taylor Dupuy: React

STRETCH GOALS: Our stretch goals are to have enhance the experience by having the map unfold when tapped with a wand (mouse that looks like a wand) and a textbox appears where the user must enter “I solemnly swear I am up to no good”. Perhaps we could also include sound effects to make the experience more enjoylable as well.

VISUALS: At this time, I haven’t created a wireframe for the site. However, I hope to make the site look and feel as similar to the Marauders Map as possible. We hope to use similar colors, textures, and fonts to give it this feel:

WEB DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK: To keep things streamlined, our team has decided to stick to React for the final project. I can’t speak for our team, but I am struggling a bit to fully grasp React and believe I would have a much harder time if I were to attempt teaching myself an entireley new framework by the end of the school year. I’m hoping over the next few classes, I will begin to feel more confident with React.
